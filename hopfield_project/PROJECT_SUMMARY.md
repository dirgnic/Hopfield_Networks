## 📖 The Three-Act Narrative

### **Act I: From Proteins to Energy Landscapes**
*Biology meets Physics*

- Protein folding in energy landscapes
- Nature's optimization: "rolling downhill"
- Transition from molecules to neurons
- Memories as valleys in energy space

**Video Reference**: "A Brain-Inspired Algorithm For Memory"

### **Act II: Building Intelligence from Simple Rules**
*Implementation with Brain Analogies*

| Step | Implementation | Brain Analogy |
|------|---------------|---------------|
| 1 | Binary vectors s_i ∈ {-1,+1} | Neurons firing/silent |
| 2 | Hebbian weights w_ij = Σξ_i·ξ_j | "Fire together, wire together" |
| 3 | Update s_i = sign(Σw_ij·s_j) | Neurons listen to neighbors |
| 4 | Energy E = -½Σw_ij·s_i·s_j | Rolling downhill to stability |
| 5 | Retrieval from noise | "Hear notes → recall song" |

### **Act III: Experiments, Capacity & Modern Extensions**
*Validation and Insights*

- **Data**: Binary 10×10 letter images (A, B, C, D, E)
- **Capacity**: Verified ~14 patterns for N=100 (0.138N)
- **Noise tolerance**: Up to 25-30% corruption
- **Spurious attractors**: "False memories" above capacity
- **Modern link**: Connection to transformer attention

## 📊 Expected Results

### Basic Retrieval
```
Noise Level    Accuracy    Iterations
10%            100%        5-10
20%            95-100%     8-12  
30%            80-90%      10-15
```

### Capacity Limits
```
Patterns      Accuracy
5 patterns    100%
10 patterns   95-100%
14 patterns   85-95%  ← Theoretical limit
20 patterns   60-70%  ← Degradation
30 patterns   <50%    ← Breakdown
```

### Energy Behavior
- Always decreases during retrieval
- Converges to local minimum
- Lower energy = more stable state

## 🎓 Key Concepts Explained

### 1. **Neurons as Binary Units**
```python
s_i ∈ {-1, +1}  # Firing (+1) or silent (-1)
```
**Brain**: Each element represents a neuron's state

### 2. **Hebbian Learning**
```python
w_ij = (1/N) Σ_μ ξ_i^μ · ξ_j^μ  # i≠j
```
**Brain**: "Cells that fire together, wire together" (Donald Hebb)

### 3. **Energy Function**
```python
E(s) = -½ Σ_ij w_ij · s_i · s_j
```
**Brain**: Measures "consistency" - lower = more stable

### 4. **Update Dynamics**
```python
s_i^(t+1) = sign(Σ_j w_ij · s_j^(t))
```
**Brain**: Each neuron listens to its neighbors

### 5. **Associative Memory**
```
Noisy/Partial Input → Network Dynamics → Complete Memory
```
**Brain**: Hear a few notes, recall the whole song
