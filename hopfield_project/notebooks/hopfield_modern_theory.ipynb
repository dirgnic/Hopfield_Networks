    "\n",
    "### 1.1 The Basic Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "**Brain Analogy:** Imagine your brain as a landscape of hills and valleys. Each memory is a valley - a stable state where you naturally settle. When you try to remember something, your brain \"rolls downhill\" from a noisy or partial cue to the complete memory stored in the nearest valley.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Mathematical Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "**Neurons:** Binary states $s_i \\in \\{-1, +1\\}$ for $i = 1, \\ldots, N$\n",
    "- Think: Each neuron either fires (+1) or stays silent (-1)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Patterns to Store:** $\\xi^\\mu$ for $\\mu = 1, \\ldots, P$\n",
    "- Think: Each pattern is a snapshot of which neurons fire together\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Rule (Hebbian):**\n",
    "$$w_{ij} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{\\mu=1}^{P} \\xi_i^\\mu \\xi_j^\\mu$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Think: \"Neurons that fire together, wire together\"\n",
    "- If neurons i and j are often active together across memories, their connection strengthens\n",
    "\n",
    "**Energy Function:**\n",
    "$$E(s) = -\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i,j} w_{ij} s_i s_j$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Think: Energy measures how \"uncomfortable\" the current brain state is\n",
    "- Low energy = stable memory\n",
    "- High energy = confused/incorrect state\n",
    "\n",
    "**Update Rule:**\n",
    "$$s_i^{(t+1)} = \\text{sign}\\left(\\sum_j w_{ij} s_j^{(t)}\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Think: Each neuron \"listens\" to its neighbors and decides whether to fire\n",
    "- The network dynamics guarantee energy always decreases (rolls downhill)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Key Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "**Capacity:** ~0.138N patterns can be stored reliably\n",
    "- Store more and you get \"false memories\" (spurious attractors)\n",
    "- Think: Your brain can only remember so many faces clearly\n",
    "\n",
    "**Energy Guarantee:** $E(t+1) \\leq E(t)$ always\n",
    "- Think: You always roll downhill, never uphill\n",
    "- This guarantees convergence to a stable state"

    "\n",
    "### 2.1 The Limitation of Classical Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Classical Hopfield networks can only store ~0.138N patterns. For a network with 1000 neurons, that is only 138 patterns. For face recognition with thousands of people, this is insufficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 The Modern Solution (Ramsauer et al., 2020)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Innovation:** Change the energy function to allow exponential capacity!\n",
    "\n",
    "**New Energy Function:**\n",
    "$$E(\\xi) = -\\text{lse}(\\beta \\mathbf{X}^T \\xi) + \\frac{1}{2} \\xi^T \\xi + \\beta^{-1} \\log(M) + \\frac{1}{2} M$$\n",

    "- $\\text{lse}(x) = \\log \\sum_i e^{x_i}$ (log-sum-exp)\n",
    "- $\\mathbf{X}$ is the matrix of stored patterns (columns)\n",
    "- $\\beta$ is an inverse temperature parameter\n",
    "- $M$ is the number of stored patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "**Brain Analogy:** Instead of simple linear interactions, neurons now use sophisticated \"attention\" mechanisms to decide which memory to recall. This is similar to how your brain focuses attention on relevant memories while ignoring irrelevant ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 The Update Rule\n",
    "\n",
    "**Modern Update (Continuous Hopfield):**\n",
    "$$\\xi^{(t+1)} = \\mathbf{X} \\cdot \\text{softmax}(\\beta \\mathbf{X}^T \\xi^{(t)})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Breaking it down:**\n",
    "1. Compute similarity: $\\mathbf{X}^T \\xi^{(t)}$ measures how similar the current state is to each stored memory\n",
    "2. Apply attention: $\\text{softmax}(\\beta \\cdot)$ focuses on the most similar memories\n",
    "3. Retrieve: $\\mathbf{X} \\cdot$ reconstructs the pattern by weighted combination\n",
    "\n",
    "**Brain Analogy:** \n",
    "- Step 1: \"Which face does this remind me of?\"\n",
    "- Step 2: \"Focus attention on the most similar faces\"\n",
    "- Step 3: \"Recall the best matching face\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4 Exponential Capacity\n",
    "\n",
    "**Result:** Can store up to $\\text{exp}(N)$ patterns!\n",
    "\n",
    "For N=1000:\n",
    "- Classical: 138 patterns\n",
    "- Modern: $10^{434}$ patterns (practically unlimited)\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Why This Matters\n",
